# Crime-Classification-and-Pattern-Detection-in-Chicago-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
This project used supervised machine learning methods to classify crimes and unsupervised methods to find patterns in crime types in Chicago. The dataset was obtained 
from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR system (2025), includes reports of crimes grouped into general categories. The classification models used were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to 
simplify the data, while clustering methods like K-Means and DBSCAN were used for clustering. After implementation, MLP achieved the highest accuracy among the classification models. On the other hand, DBSCAN was better for clustering and identifying crime hotspots. This study offers valuable information for crime trend analysis and law enforcement decision-making.
